/* * Scratch space (SCRATCH)
   SCRATCH is designed for processing data from a UIO stream in
   chunks. It allows you to easily save parts of a chunk by setting
   the ~scratch.valid_*~ pointers, i.e.

   : struct scratch ss;
   : scratch_init(&ss);

   ... set the buffer to the string ~"01234"~ ...

   : ss.valid_beg += 3;
   : scratch_flush_left(&ss);

   This will result in the buffer containing the string ~"34"~. You
   can then fill the remaining chunk with

   : scratch_fill_end(&ss, &is);

   The buffer now contains ~{ '3', '4', '\0' }~ and then ~"567" ...~
   or whatever is in the stream ~is~. */

        char *valid_end;
};
