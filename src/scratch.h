/* * Scratch space (SCRATCH)
   SCRATCH is designed for processing data from a UIO stream in
   chunks. It allows you to easily save parts of a chunk by setting
   the ~scratch.valid_*~ pointers, i.e.

   : struct uio is = ...; // feeds ascending numbers
   :
   : struct scratch ss;
   : scratch_init(&ss);
   :
   : scratch_fill(&ss, &is);

   If the scratch buffer had a size of 6 it would now contain ~"012345"~.

   : ss.valid_beg += 2;
   : ss.valid_end -= 2;
   :
   : scratch_fill(&ss);

   This will result in the buffer containing the string ~"236789"~. */
